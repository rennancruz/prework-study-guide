# Project Getting The Magic Started

## Description
- This repo represent the beginning of my bootcamp journey
- This project helped me gain basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills

## Installation
I needed to properly set my GitHub account, create a new repo, download the pre-work files and install it against my repo.

After all of that is done, you can begin your magic!

## Usage
In this small project, the UI will display content of what was learned throughout this learning experience. Which includes:
- HTML notes
- CSS notes
- Git notes
- JavaScript notes

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

## Credits
To the excellent modules listed out there. Even if I didn't know code before, I'm sure it's super self explanatory and anyone could learn on their own!

## License

MIT license.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features
Basic HTML, CSS, and JS work.

## How to Contribute
